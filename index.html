    <h1> Reasons I like Coding-</h1>  
    <div class="line"></div> 
    <p> Just like architecture, which is an art used by people daily and affects their everyday life, so is code. You can create something and people interact with, use, touch and work with. That is an amazing feeling.Since code is a usable art, a whole team of people are connected to the practice. From the client to the account managers, and including the business people, finance, the support team, QA team, designers, product managers and project managers.

Code touches every single person in the organization and makes a difference to every single user that touches it (for good or bad).
